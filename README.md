## Dataset

[Our World in Data] (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)


This data set contains information for 207 countries (for the years 1750 - 2020) and can be broken down into five main categories:

+ CO2 emissions (ton##nes/yr): how much each country emits per year
+ Contribution of coal, oil, gas, and cement on CO2 emissions
+ Total greenhouse gas emissions by country (tonnes/yr)
+ Emissions by sectors (residential, transport, waste, industrial, etc.)
+ GDP and population per country
