# Business Objective

Predict carbon intensity by country based on energy consumption and GDP over time.

```
Carbon intensity is the measure of CO2 produced per dollar of GDP. 
Energy intensity is measured by dividing our total energy consumed by our GDP.

# Datasets

### [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)

```
This data set contains information for 207 countries (for the years 1750 - 2020)
and can be broken down into five main categories:
```

+ CO2 emissions (tonnes/yr): how much each country emits per year
+ Contribution of coal, oil, gas, and cement on CO2 emissions
+ Total greenhouse gas emissions by country (tonnes/yr)
+ Emissions by sectors (residential, transport, waste, industrial, etc.)
+ GDP and population per country


### [Oil Consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-consumption-by-country?tab=chart)

```
Oil consumption is measured in terawatt-hour (TWh) equivalents per year.
